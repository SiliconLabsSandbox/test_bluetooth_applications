inc: Header file (.h, etc)

src: All source .c, .cpp files

## CI-Bot checking

Github repos with use CI/CD system to automatic checking your pull request:

Check coding style, README.md file, build firmware and check coding quality use SonarQube tool.

If any Github check status failure, please click into that to know the reason and fix it.

Or, you can check all console log by this way:

### 2. Check README.md file

Please add all necessary title on your README.md file

The list of title need to be added into README.md file

#### 2.1 SDK version

Please follow format if you use Gecko Sdk or Simplicity SDK

If you list some board_id on templates.xml file then don't add fix board_id on .slcp file.

### Check SonarQube

It will check quality of code. If your project did not follow rules this step will be failure. It you give for you a report.
